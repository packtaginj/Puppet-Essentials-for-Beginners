## About the Video Course
Puppet is a configuration management tool that allows you to automate all your IT configurations, giving you control over what you do to each Puppet agent in a network, and when and how you do it. In this age of digital delivery and ubiquitous Internet presence, it's becoming increasingly important to implement scalable and portable solutions, not only in terms of software but also the systems that run it. 

This video course will start by walking the viewer through a complete understanding of the Puppet environment followed by detailed steps to configure their own production-grade Puppet infrastructure. An overview of the Puppet language will also be provided to make viewers feel at ease with the Puppet DSL. Once the viewer is comfortable with the Puppet ecosystem, in-depth topics such as the configuration and management of Puppet servers, environments, module repositories, and modules will follow. Users will then learn how to write reusable modules with Hiera. Towards the end of the video course, viewers will write tests for modules right from the beginning, build an efficient and scalable codebase, and create continuous integration pipelines with CI tools such as Jenkins.
